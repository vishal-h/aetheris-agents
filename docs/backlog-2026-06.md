## Housekeeping (do first, near-zero effort)

### BL-001 — Capture clean drift baseline (#42)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** now

Every drift_check output recorded so far predates at least one parser fix
(paren-depth, payload `?` marker, `_evaluate_payload_fields` extraction).
There is no recorded genuinely-clean run.

- Run `python3 scripts/drift_check.py` with `AETHERIS_DB_PATH` set.
- Expected (as observed 2026-07-15): 8 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 WARN. The 8th PASS
  is the `project_knowledge` check. INFOs fall in two benign categories:
  `env_vars` (agent-side vars in specs §1 not read by Rig) and
  `payload_fields` (event payload fields observed in the DB but not yet
  promoted to specs §6). The phantom `runs.finished_at` and
  `llm_responded.stop_reason` INFOs must be gone.
- Append the summary line to `docs/rig/current-state-2026-06.md` as
  "Drift baseline 2026-07-XX: …".

**Done when:** baseline recorded; any unexpected finding triaged.

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15 — baseline in `current-state-2026-06.md`,
commit `d24e482`. Expectation lines above corrected to observed reality
per review finding 1 (`docs/reviews/bl-001-review.md`).

---

### BL-015 — Promote nine observed payload_fields to specs §6 (#66)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** now (before BL-002)

> Numbered BL-015, not BL-010 as the review draft suggested — BL-010
> through BL-014 are existing boxy-pipeline tickets. GitHub issue #66.

The 2026-07-15 baseline (`d24e482`) reports nine payload fields observed
in DB events but absent from specs §6: `prompt_built.key`,
`prompt_built.tool_schema`, `llm_responded.content`,
`llm_responded.tool_input`, `llm_responded.tool_name`,
`llm_responded.type`, `tool_result.is_error`, `tool_result.result`,
`error.detail`. Per the BL-006 logic, observed fields get promoted — but
the §8 errata's `llm_called`/`llm_responded` divergence means each field
needs a canonical-name confirm before promotion, not a mechanical copy.

Split from BL-001 review finding 3. Ordered before BL-002 so BL-002's
single export catches the promoted fields, the corrected backlog, and the
new baseline in one manifest refresh. `stop_reason` stays with BL-006 —
still zero rows, its trigger hasn't fired; BL-015 does not subsume it.

**Done when:** each field has a disposition (promoted to §6 / errata note
/ anomaly triaged); drift_check shows zero `payload_fields` INFOs, 0 FAIL,
0 WARN.

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15. 6 canonical fields promoted to specs §6
(`prompt_built.tool_schema`; `llm_responded.tool_name`/`tool_input`;
`tool_result.result`/`is_error`; `error.detail`) — each confirmed against
current harness emission (`loop.ex:170/244/245/352/355`,
`agent/server.ex:529`). 3 fields errata-noted in specs §6, **not**
promoted: `prompt_built.key` (test-fixture `{"key":"value"}`) and
`llm_responded.content`/`type` (pre-2026-05-15 legacy emission, superseded
by `raw_response`/`response_type`) — all confined to 2026-05-12 rows.
Residual after this ticket: 3 `payload_fields` INFOs (legacy DB rows;
clear on dev-DB reset, DB read-only here) and 2 `project_knowledge` WARN
(manifest staleness from the BL-001 + BL-015 doc commits — BL-002 owns the
refresh and the clean re-verify, per BL-001 review finding 2).

**Tracked follow-up (event-triggered, not scheduled — BL-006 pattern):** a
dev-DB reset clears the three BL-015 documented-legacy payload INFOs
(`prompt_built.key`, `llm_responded.content`/`type`). **Gated on BL-003
completion** — the pre-2026-05-15 legacy rows share the May window with
BL-003's orphaned-`running` fixtures, so a reset before BL-003 consumes
them would destroy fixtures. (Note surfaced during BL-015: the DB now holds
76 `running` rows, not five — BL-003's "five orphaned rows" count is itself
stale and wants re-checking when BL-003 is scoped.)

---

### BL-002 — Refresh Claude project knowledge files (all three scopes) (#43)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** now

The Claude.ai project still carries the 2026-05-31 snapshot (superseded
handoff, pre-fix specs/architecture/runbook). This staleness is what
triggered the entire reality-check exercise. The refresh must cover all
three scopes, not just Rig:

**Rig** (replaces current stale set):
- `docs/rig/specs.md`, `docs/rig/architecture.md`, `docs/rig/runbook.md`,
  `docs/rig/milestones/p3/protocol.md`, `docs/rig/current-state-2026-06.md`
- `rig/CLAUDE.md` if conversations will touch Rig implementation
  (it is the authoritative Claude Code context for that subtree)

**aetheris-agents repo** (mostly new additions):
- Repo-root `CLAUDE.md` (refresh — now carries the doc-sync DoD)
- `docs/agent-creation-guide.md` (CLAUDE.md names it the authoritative
  agent-building reference; currently absent from project knowledge)
- `docs/capability-matrix.md` (what agents exist; orchestrator plans
  from it; needed for any "which agent does X" conversation)
- `docs/backlog-2026-06.md` (this file)

**aetheris (harness)** (currently zero representation):
- `aetheris/CLAUDE.md` if it exists (verify) — the harness-side Claude
  Code contract. Harness *source* facts (schema, event types, trajectory
  format) are deliberately NOT exported raw; they live verified in
  `current-state-2026-06.md` §7/§8/3.1 and the corrected specs.md.

**Drops:** the superseded handoff (banner already redirects) and
`docs/rig/README.md` (redundant with architecture + current-state).

**Manifest:** add `docs/project-knowledge-manifest.md` — one table:
file → commit hash at export. Refresh the manifest with every export.
This makes project-knowledge staleness mechanically detectable: the
next reality-check (or a future drift_check check) compares manifest
hashes against `git log -1 --format=%h -- <file>`.

- Convention going forward: refresh at the same boundaries the
  reality-check prompt runs at (milestone end / before handoff), and
  the manifest is part of the export, not optional.

**Done when:** project knowledge matches HEAD for all three scopes and
the manifest exists in-repo.

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15. Repos rule added to root `CLAUDE.md`; BL-001
/ BL-002 / BL-015 marked complete here and on the roadmap Active line;
`../aetheris/CLAUDE.md` confirmed present (27 KB) and in the export set.
Manifest regenerated as the final commit (hashes at HEAD after the doc
edits): `rig--specs.md`, `rig--current-state-2026-06.md`,
`backlog-2026-06.md`, `aetheris-agents--CLAUDE.md`. drift_check re-verify
at HEAD: 8 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 WARN / 7 INFO. The Claude.ai upload itself is
the human step; export file list + hashes delivered in the packet.

## Harness (aetheris/)

### BL-003 — Startup sweep for orphaned `running` runs (watchdog, cure side) (#44)
**Size:** M · **Priority:** high

Rig's "stalled?" marker (commit `0eddf20`) is the *detector*; the DB still
lies forever. As of the 2026-07-15 baseline (verified `d24e482`),
`priv/aetheris.db` holds **76** `status='running'` rows — not the five May
rows the earlier draft assumed (corrected per BL-002 review finding 2).
Census (reference fixture — re-run at execution time, see done-when):

| Last event | Count | True state | Sweep action |
|---|---|---|---|
| (no events) | 11 | orphaned | `run_orphaned`, `finished_at`=`started_at` |
| `llm_called` | 30 | orphaned | `run_orphaned`, `finished_at`=last-event ts |
| `tool_called` | 22 | orphaned | `run_orphaned`, `finished_at`=last-event ts |
| `prompt_built` | 3 | orphaned | `run_orphaned`, `finished_at`=last-event ts |
| `run_complete` | 6 | finished (status lagged) | reconcile → `done`, `finished_at`=event ts |
| `error` | 4 | errored (status lagged) | reconcile → terminal, `finished_at`=event ts |
| `agent_waiting` | 0 | none paused currently | synthetic fixture required |

- **Pre-flight — this is the project's first ticket that WRITES to the DB
  (76 status mutations, a new event type, `finished_at` stamps).** Before
  the first sweep run, copy `priv/aetheris.db` aside (plain file copy; the
  harness must not be running during the sweep). The census is the
  acceptance fixture; the backup is the undo button if the sweep mishandles
  real rows on first contact. Record the backup path in the implementation
  notes; delete it after the done-check passes.
- On harness application start (and/or a `mix aetheris sweep` task), find
  runs where `status='running'` and the owning process is provably gone
  (no live GenServer for the run_id; last event older than a **named config
  threshold** — see below).
- **Orphaned (66, no terminal event):** mark `failed`; emit a new
  **`run_orphaned`** event type — per harness rule 14 this is a three-place
  change in one commit: `event.ex` union **and** `Trajectory.File`
  `@event_type_map` **and** specs §6, then drift_check. `finished_at` =
  last-event timestamp; for the 11 no-event rows, `started_at`. **Never
  sweep time** — that fabricates the dormancy gap into the run duration.
- **Reconcilable (10, last event `run_complete`/`error`):** adopt the
  terminal outcome the events already record — set `runs.status` to
  `done`/error and `finished_at` to the terminal event's timestamp; emit
  **no** new event (the trajectory already tells the truth); log one
  reconciliation line. Do **not** overwrite a real outcome with `failed`.
- Must not touch legitimately paused runs: a run whose latest event is
  `agent_waiting` with an unexpired `wait_condition` in `run_checkpoints`
  is paused, not dead. **Zero such runs exist in the current DB** — the
  exclusion path has no live fixture, so build a **synthetic
  `wait_for_event` run** during the ticket to exercise it; do not assume
  it is present.
- The liveness **threshold is a named config key**, not a buried constant:
  name it, pick a default with one sentence of rationale, and document it
  in `runbook.md` (runbook update rule — operational knob, same commit).
- Specs §6's `run_orphaned` row **notes the status mapping** (event
  `run_orphaned`, status `failed`) so the event/status asymmetry reads as
  designed, not accidental.
- Write `finished_at` when sweeping (note: Rig's `TrajectoryMeta` treats
  missing `finished_at` as `""`).

**Do not:** change Rig's stalled? detector (ships as-is; this is the cure
side); clean up the BL-015 legacy event rows (separately gated on this
ticket's completion).

**Done when:** re-run the census pre-sweep (fresh numbers, not the
`d24e482` reference) → sweep → post-sweep counts match that fresh census:
orphaned rows marked `failed` with `run_orphaned`, reconcilable rows
adopted to their recorded terminal outcome, **0** rows remain `running`;
both censuses in the implementation notes; a kill-9'd run is swept on next
harness start; a synthetic `wait_for_event` run survives; drift_check
passes (`--strict` if BL-009 landed).

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15. `Aetheris.Sweep` ships the cure: startup hook
(after checkpoint resume, gated by `config :aetheris, :sweep_on_start`,
default on) plus `mix aetheris sweep`. New `run_orphaned` event type added
via the rule-14 three-place change (`event.ex` union + `Trajectory.File`
`@event_type_map` + specs §6, one commit); drift `event_types` parity holds
at 22 types. Fresh pre-sweep census matched the `d24e482` reference exactly
(66 orphaned / 10 reconcilable / 0 paused); post-sweep **0** rows remain
`running`. Liveness threshold is the named config key
`:sweep_liveness_threshold_ms` (default 300 000 ms, mirroring Rig's "stalled?"
display detector; documented in `runbook.md`). Paused-run exclusion exercised
with a synthetic unexpired `wait_for_event` fixture (survives, not merely
created). Methodology §6 repo-qualified-Touches rule batched into this commit
per the approved promotion. Implementation notes + both censuses in
`../aetheris/docs/aetheris/milestones/bl-003-startup-sweep-implementation-notes.md`.

### BL-004 — Per-run token totals in RunSummary (#45)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** low

Gap A residual ("Rig-side addressed" note in current-state doc): cost
landed in the run list; token totals did not.

- Same pattern as `total_cost_usd` in `harness.rs` `harness_list_runs`:
  correlated subquery `SUM(json_extract(payload_json,'$.input_tokens'))` /
  `'$.output_tokens'` over `type='llm_responded'` (tokens live ONLY in
  `llm_responded` — see specs §6 / report errata).
- `RunSummary` + `types.ts` + optional column or tooltip in `RunList.tsx`
  (the table is at 8 columns; consider folding tokens into the Cost
  cell's tooltip instead of a 9th column).
- Update specs §3; run drift_check.

**Done when:** token totals visible per run; NULL stays NULL for stub runs.

### BL-016 — Fix standing `payslip_orchestrator` test failure (#67)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** medium

`test/aetheris/agents_test.exs:22` ("payslip_orchestrator.exs evaluates to a
valid RunConfig") is **red on `main`** and has been since before BL-003.
Surfaced during BL-003's suite run and triaged per the standing pristine-HEAD
rule: with BL-003's work stashed, `mix test test/aetheris/agents_test.exs`
still fails identically (`git stash push --include-untracked` → run → pop), so
it is not a BL-003 regression. Evidence in `docs/reviews/bl-003-review.md`
finding 2 and `bl-003-startup-sweep-implementation-notes.md`.

- The test asserts `agents/payslip_orchestrator.exs` resolves to tools
  `["run_command", "spawn_agent", "wait_for_all"]` (test lines 43–45), but the
  agent file currently yields only `["run_command"]` — `assert "spawn_agent" in
  result.tools` fails (`left: "spawn_agent", right: ["run_command"]`).
- Decide the source of truth: either the agent file lost `spawn_agent` /
  `wait_for_all` (restore them) or the test is ahead of the file (correct the
  assertion). Do not silently delete the assertion.

**Why it matters:** a standing red test normalises "1 failure is expected" and
lets the *next* real failure hide behind it (alarm fatigue). Close it so the
suite is 0-failure and a new red is unambiguous.

**Done when:** `mix test` is green with no excluded/expected failures; whichever
side was wrong (agent file or test) is corrected with a one-line rationale.

---

## Rig (aetheris-agents/rig/)

### BL-005 — TrajectoryView fallback for live runs (#46)
**Size:** S–M · **Priority:** medium

`trajectory.json` is written atomically at run end (`server.ex:673,944`
via `file.ex:37-38`) — the file does not exist while a run is live, so
TrajectoryView errors for `status='running'`.

- On `trajectory_load` failure for a running run, build the same view from
  `harness_get_events`: `EventRow.payload` is a JSON *string* (SQLite) vs
  the file's inlined object — parse per row; payloads are complete/
  untruncated in both stores, so fidelity is identical.
- Reuse the existing step-grouping; show a "live — reconstructed from
  events" banner; optionally reuse the p2 polling hook for live append.
- `meta` is unavailable pre-completion except via `runs.config_json` —
  render what's derivable, leave the rest blank.
- Update the runbook troubleshooting entry ("use the Events tab for live
  runs") to reflect the new behavior.

**Done when:** opening Trajectory on a running run shows events instead of
an error; completed runs unchanged.

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15. `TrajectoryView` falls back to
`harness_get_events` + `harness_get_run` on `trajectory_load` failure and
rebuilds the step-grouped view via `src/lib/reconstructTrajectory.ts`; the
`run` prop replaces `runId` so the banner can vary by status. **Scope
widened** past "for a running run" per the ticket's own recommendation:
BL-003 swept 66 orphaned runs to `failed` with no trajectory file either, so
the fallback triggers on any `trajectory_load` failure, with the banner
reading `live — reconstructed from events` (running) vs `trajectory file
unavailable — reconstructed from events` (terminal — covers absent *and*
corrupt/`.tmp` files, with the read error logged to console). p2 polling reused
for live append (decision: **in** — free via the existing `useRunEvents` hook).
Fidelity verified byte-identical against a real 58-event `trajectory.json`,
guarded durably by `rig/scripts/verify-reconstruct-trajectory.ts`. Export JSON
hidden in reconstructed mode. No new Tauri command (specs §4 unchanged).

---

### BL-006 — Document `stop_reason` when first observed (#47)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** tracked (event-triggered, not scheduled)

Confirmed absent from all current DB events (count = 0). The trigger is
mechanical: when drift_check emits
`INFO payload_fields: llm_responded.stop_reason in DB events but not
listed in specs.md §6`, add `stop_reason` to the §6 `llm_responded` row —
no `?` suffix needed, since by then it is observed. The `?` convention
exists for the general case; this ticket just records the trigger.

**Done when:** the INFO fires once and the field is promoted.

---

### BL-017 — Resolve `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint failures (#68)
**Size:** S–M · **Priority:** after BL-016 (standing-red gate)

`bun run lint` (`eslint .`) is red on `main`: **31** `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
errors across ~15 files. Origin is a bump of `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` that
promoted the rule to error — undated, because the gate had not been run
whole-project until BL-005 ran it off-territory (per the gate-boundary rule now
in `CLAUDE.md`). The flagged pattern is the idiomatic `if (!id) { setData(null) }`
reset at the top of the data hooks (`useHarness`, `useTrajectory`, `useRunDiff`,
the `use*` corpus/provenance hooks) plus a few views (`OrchestratorView:140`,
`PlaygroundView:295/325/333/341`). No BL-005 file is among them.

**Decide first, before touching any site:** does this codebase *adopt* the rule
(refactor all ~15 sites so effects don't call `setState` synchronously — the
lint-clean-per-file path) or *reject* it (disable the rule in `eslint.config.js`
with a comment stating why the guard pattern is acceptable here)? Pin the
decision in this ticket; do **not** let it be settled implicitly by silencing
errors file-by-file.

**Done when:** `bun run lint` exits 0, and the adopt-vs-reject decision is
recorded (in the rule-config comment if rejected, or in the notes if adopted).

---

## Milestones (L — issue docs first, per repo convention)

### BL-007 — Replay / fork from step (Rig p9 candidate) (#48)
**Size:** L · **Priority:** medium

Feasibility confirmed (report Gap C + §3.1): trajectory files store full
untruncated prompts (`meta.system_prompt`/`user_prompt`) and complete
tool-call/tool-result payloads, so the conversation at step N is
mechanically reconstructable for completed runs — `run_checkpoints` is
only needed for live ones. No recording changes required.

Scope sketch for the milestone docs:
- Harness: `Aetheris.fork_run(run_id, step)` — rebuild messages up to
  step N from the trajectory, start a new run with provenance back-link
  (consider reusing `agent_trees` for the parent/child relation).
- Rig: one Tauri command + a "Fork from here" affordance on a step group
  in TrajectoryView.
- Decide divergence semantics up front: forked run gets a fresh run_id
  and records normally; original is never mutated.
- New event types or config fields → event.ex/specs §6 in the same
  commit (drift_check enforces).

**Done when:** milestone README + issue docs exist; implementation gated
on them, per the p3 pattern (docs → mock/real split if useful → UI).

---

### BL-008 — Skills auto-extraction + Rig skills view (compounding) (#49)
**Size:** L · **Priority:** medium-low

The "compounding/dreaming" idea from the Burr HN thread, grounded in what
exists: `skills` table schema-complete (`store.ex:817`), write path live
(`insert_skill`, `store.ex:132/619`), public API `Aetheris.extract_skill`
(`lib/aetheris.ex:111`) — but nothing calls it automatically and nothing
reads the table. Operationally empty.

Scope sketch:
- Harness: post-run hook (opt-in via RunConfig flag) that calls
  `extract_skill` for successful runs matching criteria (e.g. ≥N steps,
  `reason: agent_finished`); populate `source_run_ids_json`.
- Dedup/quality gate before insert (don't accumulate near-identical
  skills from repeated sprint runs).
- Rig: read-only Skills section under Harness (one command, one view —
  follow the harness.rs / RunList.tsx pattern per runbook's "Adding a
  new module" steps).
- Relation to `api/tenant/scripts/extract_skill_hints.py` (separate,
  domain-specific): document the distinction or unify deliberately.
- Schema/command/doc changes → drift_check in the same commit.

**Done when:** milestone docs exist; a normal sprint run leaves at least
one skill row behind and Rig can show it.

---

## Drift apparatus (optional hardening)

### BL-009 — Promote sprint drift_check to `--strict` (#50)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** after BL-001

Zero standing WARNs was achieved (f2/provenance command tables added).
Flip the sprint.sh case to `drift_check.py --strict` so new WARNs fail the
sprint instead of accumulating into the next alarm-fatigue cycle.

**`project_knowledge` staleness exemption (decision 2026-07-15).** Under
`--strict`, manifest-*staleness* WARNs are reported but do **not** fail —
every doc commit re-stales the manifest until the next export, so mid-cycle
staleness is expected truth between export boundaries, not regression. The
invariant becomes **"zero *unexplained* WARNs"**, not "zero WARNs".
Structural manifest problems (missing manifest, unknown repo, git failure)
are **not** exempt and still fail. Land the promoted standing rule in
CLAUDE.md alongside: *ticket text quoting repo state cites the commit it was
verified against; divergence is a deviation to note, never silently follow*
(source: BL-001, BL-015, BL-002).

**Done when:** sprint runs `--strict` and passes; CLAUDE.md doc-sync
section documents strict mode, the exemption + rationale, and the standing
rule.

**Depends on:** BL-001 (#42)

**Status:** Done 2026-07-15. `drift_check.py` `--strict` exempts
`project_knowledge` staleness via a `strict_exempt` flag on `record`
(only the staleness WARN at the manifest-comparison site; structural pk
WARNs still promote to FAIL). `sprint.sh` drift case flipped to `--strict`.
CLAUDE.md doc-sync section updated. Exemption isolation verified: staleness
WARN → exit 0; a milestone_status WARN → `--strict` exit 1.

## boxy-pipeline

### BL-010 — Clean order_formatter output: strip extra sheets and clear stale template formulas (#51)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** now

Two output defects observed on first real run:

1. **Extra sheets in output xlsx.** `--template` and `--catalog` point to the
   same file (`Updated_Boxy_MSRP_Sales_Order_Form.xlsx`), which contains all
   five `{N}000 Price List` and `{N}000 Order Form` sheets. openpyxl loads and
   saves the whole workbook, so the output carries all those sheets. Only
   `2000 Order Form` should be in the output file.

2. **`#NAME?` errors in unused template rows.** The template has VLOOKUP
   formulas pre-filled in rows 12–67. The formatter writes items into rows
   12–N, but rows N+1 through 67 retain the original VLOOKUP formulas. When
   openpyxl saves the workbook, named-range references in those formulas break,
   producing `#NAME?` errors visible in Excel.

**Fix (both in `scripts/order_formatter.py`):**
- After loading the template workbook, delete all sheets except `2000 Order Form`.
- After writing all line items and fee placeholder rows, clear all cells in
  columns B–K (cols 2–11) for rows `(last_written_row + 1)` through `67`. Set to `None`.

**Touches.**
- `scripts/order_formatter.py`
- `tests/test_order_formatter.py` — add tests: output has exactly one sheet;
  no `#NAME?` errors beyond last written row (`@pytest.mark.integration`)
- `docs/runbook.md` — update §"Understanding the output": rows beyond fee
  placeholders are now blank, not VLOOKUP

**Do not generate.**
- Changes to any other script
- Changes to `schema.py`

**Done-check.**

### BL-011 — Extract shared parsing helpers into `scripts/parsing_utils.py` (#52)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** before next catalog/resolver change

`_parse_dimensions`, `_extract_cabinet_type`, `_parse_color_columns`, and
`_color_name_from_header` are duplicated verbatim between
`catalog_resolver.py` and `catalog_extractor.py` (noted in t1 review,
m-boxy-pipeline-1a). A bug fix in one won't propagate to the other.

**Fix:** extract all four helpers into `scripts/parsing_utils.py`; import
from both scripts. No logic changes — pure refactor.

**Touches.**
- `scripts/parsing_utils.py` (new)
- `scripts/catalog_resolver.py` (import from parsing_utils; remove local copies)
- `scripts/catalog_extractor.py` (import from parsing_utils; remove local copies)
- `tests/test_parsing_utils.py` (new — move or copy the relevant unit tests
  from `test_catalog_resolver.py` and `test_catalog_extractor.py`)

**Do not generate.**
- Any logic change to the helpers
- Changes to `schema.py`, `main.py`, `order_formatter.py`, `plan_extractor.py`

**Done-check.**
```bash
cd aetheris-agents/boxy-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt -q
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
# All existing tests must pass unchanged
# parsing_utils.py must be the only location of the four helpers
grep -rn "_parse_dimensions\|_extract_cabinet_type\|_parse_color_columns\|_color_name_from_header" \
  scripts/catalog_resolver.py scripts/catalog_extractor.py
# Expected: only import lines, no function definitions
```

**Depends on:** BL-010 merged (clean baseline before refactor)

### BL-012 — Catalog enrichment merge strategy (#53)
**Size:** S–M · **Priority:** before anyone enriches `catalog.jsonl`

`catalog_extractor.py` currently overwrites `catalog.jsonl` on every run.
Once `mapped_20_20_codes` or `notes` fields are manually populated, a
re-extraction would silently discard all enrichment. No merge logic exists.

**Design options (decide before implementing):**

**Option A — Merge on re-extraction.** If `catalog.jsonl` already exists,
read it first, build a `{sku → enrichment}` index, then re-extract from
Excel and carry forward non-empty `mapped_20_20_codes` and non-None `notes`
from the existing file. Write the merged result.

**Option B — Separate enrichment file.** Keep `catalog.jsonl` as a
pure extraction artifact (always overwritable). Store enrichment in a
separate `data/catalog-enrichment.jsonl` keyed by SKU. The resolver merges
at load time. Enrichment file is committed (it's hand-maintained, not
generated).

**Option C — Versioned files, no overwrite.** `catalog_extractor.py` always
writes `catalog-{YYYY-MM-DD}.jsonl`; never overwrites. `catalog.jsonl` is a
symlink or a manually updated pointer. Enrichment lives in the dated file and
is carried forward manually when updating.

**Recommendation:** Option B. Cleanest separation of concerns — extraction
is always safe to re-run; enrichment is a human-maintained artifact that
belongs in git. The resolver's `load_catalog_jsonl` merges the two at load
time (after t3 lands).

**This ticket requires a design decision before implementation.** Capture the
chosen option and rationale in `docs/m-boxy-pipeline-1a.md §Enrichment
strategy` before handing to claude-code.

**Depends on:** m-boxy-pipeline-1a t3 merged (resolver reads JSONL)

### BL-013 — Parameterise column x-boundaries in `so_extractor.py` (#54)
**Size:** S–M · **Priority:** before processing a second SO PDF

`so_extractor.py` has four hardcoded x-boundary constants (`_QTY_X_MAX`,
`_SPECIAL_X`, `_RATE_X`, `_AMOUNT_X`) calibrated from SO86708_Aria_Joey.pdf.
A different Boxy SO template (different page margins, font, or column widths)
could shift columns enough to mis-assign words to the wrong column bucket.

**Fix:** detect column boundaries dynamically from the table header row
(`Quantity`, `Item`, `Special`, `Rate`, `Amount`) on the first page, rather
than using hardcoded constants. Use the header word x0 positions plus a
configurable margin to compute the bucket ranges at runtime.

**Touches.**
- `scripts/so_extractor.py` — replace four constants with a
  `_detect_col_bounds(page)` function
- `tests/test_so_extractor.py` — add unit test for `_detect_col_bounds` using
  a minimal mock page

**Do not generate.**
- Changes to `schema.py` or any other script

**Done-check.**
```bash
cd aetheris-agents/boxy-pipeline
python3 -m pytest tests/test_so_extractor.py -v
# SO86708 extraction must still produce 34 items, $8,099.54
python3 scripts/so_extractor.py \
  --so data/samples/SO86708_Aria_Joey.pdf \
  --project joey --output-dir data/projects/
```

### BL-014 — Parse Bill To and Ship To addresses separately in `_parse_header` (#55)
**Size:** S · **Priority:** low (before multi-customer use)

`so_extractor._parse_header` currently sets both `bill_to` and `ship_to` to
the customer company name (extracted from the first line of the address block).
The `SOHeader` schema has distinct fields for a reason: real SOs may bill to
one address and ship to another. SO86708 happens to use the same company name
for both, so the approximation is invisible in the done-check.

**Fix:** use word x-coordinate extraction on the address block (the three
columns below "Bill To | Ship To | Customer") to separately capture the Bill
To address (x < ~200) and Ship To address (~200 < x < ~370), including
multi-line street/city/state/zip.

**Touches.**
- `scripts/so_extractor.py` — extend `_parse_header` with coordinate-based
  address block parsing
- `tests/test_so_extractor.py` — add integration tests: `bill_to` contains
  "Brokaw" (the SO86708 bill-to street), `ship_to` contains "Laurel"

**Do not generate.**
- Changes to `schema.py` or any other script

## Suggested order

| Order | Ticket | Why first |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | BL-001, BL-015, BL-002 | Minutes each; locks in everything just built. BL-015 before BL-002 so one export catches the §6 promotions |
| 2 | BL-010 | First real run revealed output defects; fix before next client demo |
| 3 | BL-003 | Done. 76 orphaned `running` rows (66 orphaned / 10 reconcilable) cured; pairs with the shipped stalled? marker |
| 4 | BL-005 | Small, immediate daily-use value |
| 5 | BL-009 | One-line change once baseline holds |
| 6 | BL-011 | Refactor before more scripts share the helpers |
| 7 | BL-004 | Trivial, batch with any harness.rs touch |
| 8 | BL-012 | Design decision first; implement after 1a t3 merges |
| 9 | BL-013 | Needed before testing a second SO template |
| 10 | BL-014 | Low-effort address fix; do with BL-013 pass |
| 11 | BL-007 → BL-008 | Milestone-sized; docs-first per repo convention |
| — | BL-006 | Fires on its own trigger |
