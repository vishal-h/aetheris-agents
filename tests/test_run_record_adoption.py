"""Every producer adopts the run record, and each adoption says what verifies it (ds t2).

One file rather than five, because the property is a **census over the producer set**: that
each of the six producers records, that no other use case pretends to, and that the six are
the six the registry plus the producer criterion yield. Split per use case, the census
clause — the one that catches a seventh producer landing unrecorded — would have no home.

**How the six are derived, since `docs/use-cases.md` alone does not yield them.** The
registry has TEN rows and carries no producer column; its membership criterion
(`D/tests/conftest.py` + `D/scripts/`) is about separately-testable code. The registry
supplies the population and this criterion supplies the subset:

    a producer writes a durable local artifact that a later reader inspects
    to establish what a run produced.

`api/gateway` and `api/tenant` write no local files at all. `drive` and `email` write only
*inbound* fetches (`drive_download.py`, `email_download_template.py` pull a remote file into
`data/`) — input-fetchers, not producers. The remaining six are the producers. Both halves
are asserted below, so the set cannot drift silently in either direction.

**What each adoption is verified by** is the second thing this file records, because the
six are not equally exercised and a uniform-looking test file would imply they were:

| use case | verified by |
|---|---|
| `docbuilder` | its own CLI subprocess tests — `docbuilder/tests/test_run_record_adoption.py` |
| `cloudcost`  | its own suite drives both instrumented stages; asserted here structurally |
| `payslip`    | its suite drives the generator loop; asserted here structurally |
| `eduloka`    | structural only — its stages need a live search provider |
| `provenance` | structural only — its report stage needs a populated DuckDB |
| `boxy-pipeline` | **dormant**; `boxy-pipeline/tests/test_run_record_adoption.py`, deselected from the gate |
